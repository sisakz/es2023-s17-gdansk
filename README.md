## Introduction

This document aims to summarize the experiences, strengths, and areas for improvement in the Web Development (Skill 17) sector of the EuroSkills Gdansk 2023 competition. The objective is to provide insights for enhancing the quality of future events.

## Positive Experiences

### Family-Like and Supportive Atmosphere
- The event was characterized by a friendly, family-like environment where competitors and experts helped each other.

### Dedicated Chief and Deputy Chief Experts
- The Chief Expert and Deputy Chief Expert, Franz and Roberts respectively, displayed dedicated work and a positive approach, contributing to a smoothly run competition.

### Well-Written Test Projects
- The test projects were well-formulated, thanks to the hard work of Sebastian and Syril, offering a balanced set of challenges for the participants.

### Dockerized Environment with GitLab and CI/CD
- The integration of Docker, GitLab, and CI/CD pipelines streamlined the development workflow, enhancing productivity and focus.

## Areas for Improvement

### Competition Area Drawbacks
- Issues such as a claustrophobic environment, temperature fluctuations, excessive noise, and a small expert room affected the overall experience.

### Weak Infrastructure
- Suboptimal PC and network capabilities caused intermittent disruptions.

### Design Challenges
- Having tasks where competitors need to create their own designs may detract from the main focus of web development.

### Task Optimization
- Tasks need further fine-tuning so competitors can focus solely on solving them. This will also expedite and clarify the scoring process.

### Docker-GitLab-CI/CD Optimization
- The Docker-GitLab-CI/CD setup could be further optimized for more fluid and transparent operations.

### Better Trainings to Avoid Poor Outputs
- Implementing and sharing best practices for the training to prevent competitors from delivering subpar or visually unappealing work.

### Software Infrastructure Preparations
- The software infrastructure list (IL) requires more thorough and early preparation. With multiple frameworks serving different purposes, it's crucial to ensure fair competition by providing equal opportunities within possible modules. Finding the right balance between the quantity and manageability of packages is essential.

### Communication
- The communication channels should be optimized for better clarity, including more written information and less reliance on verbal announcements.

## Future Development Opportunities

1. **Invest in Better Infrastructure:** Ensuring high-performance PCs and a reliable network will significantly improve the experience for all involved.
2. **Optimize Task Briefings:** Make sure that the tasks are as clear and straightforward as possible.
3. **Expand the Expert Room and Include Audio Systems:** Not only is a larger room for experts needed, but an audio system should also be installed to facilitate clear communication.
4. **Enhance Automated Systems:** CI/CD and other automation tools might be more user-friendly, robust, and transparent.
5. **More Written Communication:** Replace verbal instructions with more written ones â€” be it via forums, WhatsApp, projected screens, or printed materials. This would help in avoiding misunderstandings due to language barriers and cultural differences.
  
## Conclusion

The EuroSkills Gdansk 2023 event in Skill 17 - Web Development was largely successful but had room for significant improvements. Investing in these areas will undoubtedly result in an even more successful competition in the future.
